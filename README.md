# Artemis-TE
WELCOME

Hello everyone, my name is Travis, this is my personal repository for my updates to the main Artemis Assault project by the GameDevSG community. If you're looking for the main project please check out the Discord here https://discord.gg/gamedevsg.

ABOUT

Artemis TE stands for Trav's Edition. I'm using this repository to keep backups of any work I do on the project as well as using it as a spinoff of the main project for my own personal preference changes. I'm hoping there will be some pieces you might like to use as well so feel free to copy select portions into your own version of the project.

UPDATES

If you'd like to follow along with what I'm working on, check out the current happenings on my Trello page https://trello.com/b/5Yr4I0v7/artemis-te
